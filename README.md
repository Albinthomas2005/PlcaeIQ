# PlaceIQ - Centralized Campus Placement & Recruitment Management System

A full-stack, enterprise-grade Campus Placement and Recruitment automation platform built with **React (Frontend)**, **PHP REST API (Backend)**, and **SQL Database (SQLite / MySQL)**.

---

## Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (React + Vite)  <─── /api/ proxy ───>  Backend (PHP REST API)  <─── PDO ───>  Database (placeiq.db / MySQL)
   localhost:5173                                   localhost:8000                           backend/db/
```

- **Frontend:** React 19, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Canvas Confetti, Recharts.
- **Backend:** Modular PHP 8.5 REST API running on PHP built-in server or Apache/Nginx.
- **Database:** Relational SQL database managed via PDO (SQLite default zero-config, with full MySQL support).

## Database Schema (`backend/db/schema.sql`)

The database consists of 6 primary tables:
1. `users` — Authentication credentials for Student 1 (`1`/`1`), Student 2 (`2`/`2`), Student 3 (`3`/`3`), Placement Admin, and Company Recruiters.
2. `students` — Candidate academic profiles, CGPA, branch, backlogs, skills, and placement status.
3. `companies` — Partner hiring firms, tiers, industry, and HR contacts.
4. `jobs` — Campus recruitment drives, eligibility cutoffs, CTC, deadlines, and interview rounds.
5. `applications` — Student drive applications, screening progress, and formal offer letters.
6. `interviews` — Live interview schedule slots, venues, and status.
